# ffxiv-icons

SVGs of some FFXIV icons, originally made because I was unhappy with the quality of some that I had found online. Not perfect, but I believe they're better.

These were created by using Inkscape's bitmap tracing tool to generate a very rough shape, then tweaking manually. The source bitmaps used were either from the official [Fan Kit](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/fankit/icon/), or in the case of Sage and Reaper, the Endwalker expansion site.
